# How do I change spawns?
Check out the folders in [Configs/AirbaseLayout](/VtolVrRankedMissionSetup/tree/main/VtolVrRankedMissionSetup/Configs/AirbaseLayout) There's a json file for the different airbase types.

Each spawn is broken out into the aircraft it's from. Each entry in the array will spawn an additional aircraft of that type.

# How do I change the equipment
Check out the files in [Configs/ScenarioMode](/VtolVrRankedMissionSetup/tree/main/VtolVrRankedMissionSetup/Configs/ScenarioMode). Each Json file defines how the scenario will be set up.

You can even add new modes by making your own json file there.
